# fastMatrix
The end goal is to have a C++ program that uses multithreading for fast linear alegbra calculation

Currently, I am setting up the implementing the most basic functionalities that I want to have in this project. So far, I have a basic matrix class, a way of multiplying matricies, and unit testing has been set up.

The project was developed in visual studio community 2019. See bottom of the page for my installed packages.
